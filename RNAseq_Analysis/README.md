# RNA-seq Analysis

## Alignment 
Alignment of RNAseq reads perfomed using [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR.git), an RNA specific alignment software. This must be performed before any further analysis is done.
## Circular RNA
Circular RNA is a type of single stranded RNA with a closed-loop structure. It has garnered a lot of interest in recent years due to it's potential roles in cellular function and gene expression and has been linked to neurological disorders. 

Detection and reconstruction of circular RNAs among further analysis executed using [CircTools](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/circtools/tree/master).
