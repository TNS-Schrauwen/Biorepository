# Manta

Manta is useful for CNV calling. Please refer to the [Illumina Manta github repository](https://github.com/Illumina/manta/tree/master) for more specific information on the software. Here we have scripts for Manta Germline runs and Turmor Normal analysis. We opted to annotate Manta using AnnotSV.
