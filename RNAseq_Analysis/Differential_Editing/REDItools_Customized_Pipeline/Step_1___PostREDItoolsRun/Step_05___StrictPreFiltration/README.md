# Step 5: Strict Pre-Filtration

### Step 5 Strict Pre-Filteration Scaffold Protocol:

1) Edit the `ipynb` to have the following (described below):

| Variable | Description |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `output_file_name` | Output file basename of your choice. |
| `tsv_file_path` | Specify the path to the tsv found in Step_4___FilterationViaProportion___BasicPreFilteration in the Part 5 subfolder. |

2) Run the `ipynb`. It will create the output folder based on your input path.
