# RNA-seq Analysis

## Alignment 
Alignment of RNAseq reads perfomed using [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR.git), an RNA specific alignment software. This must be performed before any further analysis is done.
## Circular RNA
Circular RNA is a type of single stranded RNA with a closed-loop structure. It has garnered a lot of interest in recent years due to it's potential roles in cellular function and gene expression and has been linked to neurological disorders. 

Detection and reconstruction of circular RNAs among further analysis executed using [CircTools](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/circtools/tree/master).

## Differential Editing
Differential editing in RNA is a post-transcriptional process in which individual nucleotides within a sequence are modified. A-to-I editing, catalyzed by ADAR proteins, takes a particular interest as it is one of the most common forms of editing. 

## Differential Expression
Differential expression allows us to identify genes that are upregulated or downregulated across samples (diseased vs. healthy). 

## Differential Splicing
Differential splicing involves the inclusion or exclusion of certain exons during pre-mRNA maturation resulting in multiple isoforms of a single gene, eventually encoding various protein isoforms. 

## Nonsense-mediated Decay (NMR)
NMR is a quality control mechanism that idenfities premature RNA stop codons and degrades them before they become proteins. Alternative splicing is frequently coupled to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) through regulated inclusion or skipping of exons encoding premature stop codons.
